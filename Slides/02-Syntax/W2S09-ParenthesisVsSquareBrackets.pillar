- ==( )== just changes the priority of an execution but the program is executed
- ==[ ]== blocks program execution: the program is NOT executed

${slide:title= Use [ ] for 'Unknown' Execution Occurrence}$

Use ==[ expressions ]== when:
- ==expressions== may not be executed at all (if, and, ...)
- ==expressions== may be executed multiple times (while, ...)

- ==( ) == is about changing the order of a computation
- ==[ ]== is freezing the computation and controlling it
