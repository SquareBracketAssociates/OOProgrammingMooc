# Implement ==not==
# Implement ==|== (or) and ==ifTrue:ifFalse:==

${slide:title=Exercise 1: Implement not}$

Propose an implementation of ==not== in a world where:
- You have: ==true==, ==false==
- You only have objects and messages
- How would you implement: ==not==?

[[[
   false not
   -> true

   true not
   -> false
]]]

${slide:title=Exercise 2: Implement \| (or)}$

Propose an implementation of ==or== in a world where:
- You have: ==true==, ==false==
- You only have objects and messages
- How would you implement: ==not==?

[[[
   true | true -> true
   true | false -> true
   true | anything -> true

   false | true -> true
   false | false -> false
   false | anything -> anything
]]]


${slide:title=Exercise 3: Why These Exercises?}$

- You are never going to implement Booleans in your life
- So why do we think these exercises are so important?
