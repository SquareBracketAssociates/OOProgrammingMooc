${slide:title=What You Will Learn}$

- The system is alive: Communicate with it
- The debugger is your best friend
- Don't be afraid of it

${slide:title=Debugging}$

- Closing the debugger does not solve bugs
- The debugger is your best friend
- The debugger
-- communicates with objects of the context
-- checks state
-- sends messages to specific objects
-- compiles code on the fly
-- continues without restarting from scratch

Watch the videos and practice

${slide:title=Simple Trace}$

[[[
Transcript show: 'x = ', x printString
]]]

- Used when you don't have tools
- Often inefficient
- We can do better

${slide:title=Defining a Breakpoint}$

[[[
   ...
   Halt now.
]]]

==Halt now== (or ==self halt==)
- pauses the program
- invokes the debugger

${slide:title=Single-Shot Halt}$

[[[
  ...
  Halt once.
]]]

To enable it, evaluate
[[[
  Halt enableHaltOnce
]]]

==Halt once==, if enabled :
- pauses the program
- opens a debugger
- disables itself

${slide:title=Halt After n Iterations}$

[[[
Halt onCount: 10
]]]

${slide:title=Conditional Halt}$

- ==if: aSelector== stops when invoked from a ==aSelector==
- ==if: aBlock== stops if the block evaluates to ==true==


==faces== will stop only when invoked from ==printString==

[[[
Die >> faces
  ...
  Halt if: #printString
]]]

${slide:title=Conditional Halt}$

The parameter passed to ==if:== can be a test name too:

[[[
Die >> faces
  ...
  Halt if: #testLargeDice
]]]

==faces== will stop only when invoked from ==testLargeDice==

${slide:title=Create Your Own Breakpoints}$

- ==now==, ==once==, ==onCount:== and ==if:== are methods in ==Halt class==
- you can add your own methods, e.g.,

[[[
Halt class >> between: minTime and: maxTime
   (Time current
      between: minTime asTime
      and: maxTime asTime)
         ifTrue: [ self signal ]
]]]
[[[
Die >> faces
   ...
   Halt between: '00:00' and: '02:00'
]]]

==faces== will halt only between midnight and 2am.

${slide:title=What You Should Know}$

- The debugger is a powerful tool
- You should communicate with objects
- Breakpoints are powerful and customizable
