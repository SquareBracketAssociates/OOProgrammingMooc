${slide:title=Loops: Just Messages sent to Objects}$

- Messages sent to numbers, collections or blocks
- Many different ones
-- Plain loops
-- Conditional loops
-- Iterators


${slide:title=Loops: n timesRepeat: anAction}$

To repeat a given number of times an action

[[[
	4 timesRepeat: [ self doSomething ]
]]]


${slide:title=Loops:  x to: y do: anAction}$

[[[
1 to: 100 do:
    [ :i | ... i ... ]
]]]

==to:do:== is a method defined on ==Number==


${slide:title=Example: to:do:}$

The block is executed with the temporary ==i== taking values from 1 to 100
 
[[[
1 to: 100 do:
    [ :i | Transcript show: i ; space ]
]]]

${slide:title=Loops: to:by:do:}$

[[[
    0 to: 100 by: 3 do: [ :i | ... i ... ]
]]]

==to:by:do:== is also a method defined on ==Number==

${slide:title=Example: to:by:do:}$

The block is executed with i taking values from 1 to 100 by step of 3

[[[
1 to: 100 by: 3 do:
    [ :i | Transcript show: i ; space ]
]]]

${slide:title=Basic Iterators Overview}$

- ==do:== (iterate)
- ==collect:== (iterate and collect results)
- ==select:== (select matching elements)
- ==reject:== (reject matching elements)
- ==detect:== (get first element matching)
- ==detect:ifNone:== (get first element matching or a default value)
- ==includes:== (test inclusion)
- and a lot more...


${slide:title=Loops: do:}$

[[[
    aCol do: [ :each | ... ]
]]]

The block is executed with ==each== taking as value all the elements of ==aCol==

${slide:title=Example: The do: iterator}$

[[[
#(15 10 19 68) do:  
      [:i | Transcript show: i ; cr ]
]]]

${slide:title=Loops: whileTrue:}$

[[[
    [ ... ] whileTrue: [ ... ]
]]]

Executes the argument, ==aBlock==, as long as the value of the receiver is true 

[[[
Color >> atLeastAsLuminentAs: aFloat 
  | revisedColor |
  revisedColor := self.
  [ revisedColor luminance < aFloat ] 
     whileTrue: [ revisedColor := revisedColor slightlyLighter ].
  ^ revisedColor
]]]

${slide:title=Loops: whileTrue}$

Executes the receiver, as long as its value is true

[[[
    [ ... ] whileTrue
]]]

Equivalent with ==whileFalse== and ==whileFalse:==
